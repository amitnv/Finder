# Finder


Finder(not to be confused with MacOS finder app) is an image recognition app for iOS based on CoreML engine called Inception v3. It takes input in the form of photo from camera or the photo library and analysis it to reproduce results which can be then shared to various social platforms.

NOTE:

After downloading the XCODE project make sure you select your own device in the simulator before trying to run it. Otherwise the app will crash since it won't be able to detect a physical camera module on a simulator.
